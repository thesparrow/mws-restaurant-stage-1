#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For **Stages 1-2 of Restaurant Reviews** project I will demonstrate my ability to turn a non-mobile ready, non-accessible, and non-pwa project to a fully Accessible functionaing 
Progressivew Web App. This will be done by creating a genuine first class Offline First user expereince - untilizing the powerful Service Worker which will replace any App Cache.
I will demonstrate my ability to work with media screens, responsive images, and the service worker. In Stage 2, I will introduce some major optimizations to the web app that can
be measured with Google's Ligthouse utilities. Also all of lazy loading will be added for all images at this stage.
